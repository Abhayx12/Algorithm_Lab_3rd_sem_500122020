This repository showcases various algorithm implementations from our lab exercises. Each lab explores distinct algorithmic concepts, focusing on strategies like recursion, iteration, divide and conquer, and greedy techniques. Below is an overview of each lab:

## **_LAB-1: Binary Search Tree (BST) Insertion_** 🌳
### Topic: 
Implement and compare the performance of iterative and recursive Binary Search Tree insertion techniques.

- **Description**: This lab focuses on the insertion of elements into a Binary Search Tree (BST) using both iterative and recursive methods. We also analyze the efficiency of each technique in different scenarios.

## **_LAB-2: Merge Sort vs Quick Sort_** 🆚
### Topic: 
Implement Merge Sort and Quick Sort using the divide-and-conquer strategy, and compare their efficiency on the same dataset.

- **Description**: In this lab, you will explore two fundamental sorting algorithms—Merge Sort and Quick Sort—by implementing them and comparing their performances on identical datasets.

## **_LAB-3: Matrix Multiplication Techniques_** 🔢
### Topic: 
Compare Strassen's Matrix Multiplication with the traditional method.

- **Description**: This lab involves a comparison between Strassen's matrix multiplication algorithm and the standard matrix multiplication approach. We assess their efficiency for different matrix sizes to understand their practical use cases.

## **_LAB-4: Activity Selection Problem_** 🎯
### Topic: 
Implement the Activity Selection Problem to explore the greedy algorithm approach.

- **Description**: This lab presents the Activity Selection Problem, demonstrating how the greedy algorithm can efficiently solve scheduling problems by maximizing the number of non-overlapping activities selected.
